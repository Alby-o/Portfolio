        <img class="lead-img" src="image/poster.jpg" alt="Part A Poster" />
        <p>The Mission: Design a web application that utilises the State Library of Queensland API.</p>
        <p>My team’s idea upon conclusion of Part A was to allow the player to step into the shoes of a convict and play as
          a convict on their journey to Australia. The player would select a random convict from the SLQ API that had not
          been used previously, so each person playing the game would get a different experience. The player would then read
          information about each stage of the convict’s journey before answering a question and continuing on. </p>
        <p>Part A was mostly a failure. Although our original idea was fun, we strayed a long distance away from the convict
          API data, and would rely heavily on hard-coded information rather than dynamically created information gathered
          from the API.</p>
        <p>To improve the process, I would have gotten more peer and tutor feedback as to how we could improve our idea. Although
          this was done further down the track, Part A suffered since our idea was not properly expanded and refined, and
          was simply thrown together all at once.</p>

        <h2>Step One: Brainstorming</h2>
        <p>To begin idea generation, I was placed in a group filled with strangers I didn’t know. I took lead, and with my trusty
          pen, developed this amazing work of art. My initial idea was to mainly compare the old way of doing things with
          how life is today, using datasets such as the State Library of Queensland housing, compared with Google Map’s API.</p>

        <h2>Step Two: Idea Refining</h2>
        <p>The next step was to refine down the multitude of ideas trapped inside your head to just two or three of your favourites.
          The two that I was most interested in were game-related ideas. The first was to make a Buzzfeed-style game where
          you answer questions before being assigned a convict in the SQL database with similar attributes as you. My second
          idea was to have a guessing game where you play as a randomly-selected convict as you travel to Australia.</p>

        <img class="img-left" src="image/expansion.png" alt="Step 3" />
        <h2>Step Three: Idea Expansion</h2>
        <p>After collaborating with our group and selecting the convict game as our decided upon web application, I brainstormed
          by drawing sketches of how I would envision it. My vision for the game was to use a database that stored player’s
          scores and convicts such that each player plays as a different convict. The questions would then apply to the convict
          you selected at the start of the game. As you progressed, you would learn more about the convicts who came to Australia.</p>

        <h2>Step Four: Report Writing</h2>
        <p>As I am very proficient in writing code, I took over writing the sections on interactivity, utilising the SLQ data,
          and the storyboard. This process involved collaborating with our group on all the aspects of the report so that
          we all agreed upon what should be written in each section. I then expanded upon what was agreed upon by the group
          and expanded with my own knowledge on each topic.</p>

        <img class="img-left" src="image/poster.png" alt="Step 5" />
        <h2>Step Five: Poster Creation</h2>
        <p>After deciding upon an idea for our web application, I began work on the poster. I used a map showing the path of
          the first fleet in the background and wireframes for each of the different pages the player would encounter. I
          used a big title up the top to draw attention with a small blurb underneath and another description down the bottom
          for more detailed information about the game. </p>

        <img class="img-left" src="image/pitch.png" alt="Step 6" />
        <h2>Step Six: Project Pitch</h2>
        <p>I had a general idea of what I wanted to be covered in the project pitch. I wrote up a document of dot points and
          general information I wanted covered by each topic. The pitch was then broken up to four sections for each member.
          I spoke about our design choices, those being who our target audience is, what we want from users playing our game
          and what design features we want to make it interesting.</p>

      <article class="main-text partb lead">
        <img class="lead-img" src="image/home.png" alt="Part A Poster" />
        <p>For part B, we met our Minimum Viable Product (MVP), that is has a:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Welcome / home screen</li>
          <li>Consistent and effective navigation bar,</li>
          <li>Character selection screen,</li>
          <li>Certain number quiz questions / rounds,</li>
          <li>Game over screen,</li>
          <li>Scoring system, and</li>
          <li>Theme / colour scheme.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The game also incorporated a Google Maps API functionality which went beyond the expected MVP.</p>
        <p>Part B was most definitely a success. The amount of work done was well sufficient for a working game, and included
          features beyond what we had originally wanted. Our progress demonstration to our tutors went off without a hitch
          and they were impressed with our progress.</p>
        <p>There’s not much that could be done to improve this project. At the time, our group had a very clear idea of where
          we wanted to go with the final product and a definite plan set into place to ensure this was achieved.</p>

        <h2>Step One: Paper Prototyping</h2>
        <p>After receiving a poor mark for our Part A, I was eager to receive some feedback from the paper prototyping to get
          some direction for where we should be headed with our project. I made the character selection and leader board
          / game over screen. From this we gained a lot of valuable experience as to where we should be headed with our project.</p>

        <img class="img-left" src="image/refining2.png" alt="Step 1" />
        <h2>Step Two: Idea Refining</h2>
        <p>From our feedback, it was obvious that our game relied heavily on reading and memory rather than any interactive
          or fun techniques. It was also brought to our attention that we lacked use of the API data. From here, we decided
          to change the game so you learn more about the convict as you progress through. At each stage, you find out more
          about the convict and their journey to Australia. Instead of having a guessing game, the player instead plays a
          ‘choose your own adventure game’ where ultimately you always stick to the major plot points found within the API
          data.</p>

        <h2>Step Three: Code Sharing Method</h2>
        <p>Since we were working on a group project, I wanted to introduce my group to Git as a method of code collaboration.
          I set up a Bitbucket repository and taught my group how to use Git.</p>

        <p>Using REGEX in PHP, I was able to go through the SLQ convict data and parse through the messy information to find
          content relevant to the game, and sort out convicts with unusable or illegible information.</p>

        <h2>Step Five: Character Selection</h2>
        <p>Using a combination of PHP, HTML and CSS, I created the character selection screen using ‘dummy’ convict images.
          Using JavaScript, I made the characters selectable and once one was chosen, it was then stored to the user’s local
          storage.</p>

        <img class="img-left" src="image/game.png" alt="Step 1" />
        <h2> Step Six: Implement JavaScript Gameplay</h2>
        <p>I used the parsed data in PHP to then pass to JavaScript. On the client-side, I wanted the game to display the convict
          data and have some questions based upon the convict data and collaborated with another team member to ensure this.</p>

        <h2>Step Seven: Quality Assurance</h2>
        <p>Since none of my team members had as much experience as I did with web design, I took time out to find bugs or try
          and break the website. When these issues were found, I used CSS techniques to correct any issues.</p>

        <p>Using the Google Maps API and the parsed convict data, I was able to display the Google Map displaying where each
          convict was destined to arrive in Australia.</p>

        <p>For Part C, our project was fully completed without any known bugs or issues. The game let the user play as a convict
          and travel through their experience to Australia. As a ‘choose your own adventure’ style game, the player’s options
          would change the course of the story, however, it would still come back to the convict’s main plot points covered
          within the API Data.</p>
        <p>Part C was both a success and a failure. Although the code work extremely well and without fail, there were issues
          since it was a very text-based game, and this drove away a lot of people since they didn’t want to sit down and
          play the game.</p>
        <p>To improve this, the game would need more imagery and not just present the player with a wall of text and a few options,
          but instead make the player feel like they’re in charge of the entire game.</p>

        <h2>Step One: Improve Site Aesthetics</h2>
        <p>I began by improving off of feedback given by other peers in the course. I changed the colours to make it look less
          brown and also incorporated a wooden textured background.</p>

        <h2>Step Two: Build the SQL Database</h2>
        <p>The next step was to build the database to be used by PHP and the AJAX requests. I drew upon my knowledge learned
          in INFS1200 to build a relational database.</p>

        <h2>Step Three: Prevent Convicts from Being Reused</h2>
        <p>Using the SQL database, PHP and JavaScript, I used AJAX requests to store the convict in the database once it had
          been selected. Then, when selecting random convicts to present to the player, it would exclude any already stored
          in the database to ensure each player used a different convict.</p>

        <h2>Step Four: Write a Plot Outline</h2>
        <p>Collaborating with another member, I wrote a general outline of how we want the game to progress, and it was then
          left to him to write the rest of the story.</p>

        <h2>Step Five: Distinguishing Genders</h2>
        <p>Using PHP and lists of male and female names, it was possible to distinguish the genders of each convict using their
          names, and then display gender-specific images for each convict.</p>

        <h2>Step Six: Include Convict Data in the Game</h2>
        <p>Using the script written by another member, I then used PHP to populate it with the convict’s information so it was
          specific to your selected convict.</p>

        <h2>Step Seven: Store and Display Player Options</h2>
        <p>Using AJAX requests, I was able to present the next line of text for the user to read and also store the player’s
          response. At the end of the game, the total number of players who selected each option were also displayed using
          AJAX requests.</p>

        <h2>Step Eight: Add Sound and Settings</h2>
        <p>Using JavaScript, I was able to incorporate an auto-playing sound that and a settings pane that allowed the user
          to change the volume or mute the sound.</p>

        <h2>Meeting Expectations</h2>
        <p>Looking back on my initial blog post I made in the first week of the semester, there are a few initial expectations
          that I had for the course. These were to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Make new friends in the course,</li>
          <li>Work on a cool web project I was interested in,</li>
          <li>Learn how to utilise web API’s, and</li>
          <li>Get a good grade.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So far, all of these expectations (barring the final one as grades have not been released yet) have been met. I’ve
          met a lot of like-minded people taking the same degree as I am who I collaborated really well with. I got to build
          a game, which I was warned against at the start of the semester since it’s easy to stray away from the actual API.
          Even so, I think it turned out really well. I did learn how to utilise a web API as well, incorporating both the
          required State Library of Queensland (SLQ) API and the Google Maps API.</p>
        <p>As the semester progressed on, my expectations also changed. As I fully began to understand what methods we would
          use to implement our web application, I also expected to become proficient in PHP and using it in conjunction with
          a SQL database. Before the course I had not touched PHP, so it was a very new concept to me. However, I quickly
          learned how well PHP could be utilised for websites and learned a lot over the progression of the course.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="main-text reflection">
        <h2>Learning Across the Course</h2>
        <p>Through participation in workshops, contact sessions and lectures, I learned a lot of coding knowledge to take into
          the future. I gained a lot of knowledge in:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The language PHP,</li>
          <li>Building and using relational databases for web applications, and</li>
          <li>Coherently working in a stressful team environment.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The knowledge I gained in PHP mainly came from the Workshop sessions. Before I was introduced to it, I generally
          had no idea how it worked or that it even existed. Either way, I eagerly started utilising online resources to
          further my knowledge in PHP. I also heavily utilised REGEX within my application, which I had not previously used.
          Using PHP and JavaScript in conjunction, I also utilised AJAX requests to store and retrieve data without having
          to reload the entire page.
          <p>
            <p>I also furthered my knowledge from INFS1200 while utilising a SQL relational database within my web application.
              Building the database from my initial requirements was not a difficult task, however, accessing using PHP proved
              to be difficult. I was able to get tutor help, and although it was not explicitly taught within the course,
              the tutors were an asset and without them my web application would not work.</p>
            <p>Working in a team environment where specific team members were not contributing was a new experience for myself,
              and as a team leader I found it a very difficult but educational experience while dealing with issues that
              had arisen within our team dynamic. With help from tutors I learned how to deal with the stressful situation.</p>

      </article>

      <article class="main-text reflection">
        <h2>Recommended Improvements</h2>
        <p>If I was to take the course again, there’d be a few changes I’d like to make. Specifically:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>I would ensure that the group I was getting into had the same vision as I did;</li>
          <li>That I did more testing throughout the project; and</li>
          <li>To start building the portfolio earlier.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>One thing that came back to bite me was that a few of my team members didn’t share the same vision as I did for our
          final project. I wanted my web application to be difficult to make to test and push my current skills in web design.
          However, my teammates were more interested in making something simple and easy and were not very interested in
          doing well in the project. I found this very frustrating as my group members would often do the bare minimum or
          less. I believe it’s important that if you go into the project, you need to have team members with the same attitude
          as yourself to prevent one team member from doing all the work for the rest, which can lead to unwanted stress
          and frustrating team management.</p>
        <p>If I was to take the course again, I would also like to spend more time testing our product with the target audience
          to gain critical feedback. This is something that our project lacked, and would definitely be useful as a tool
          to make sure we were staying on track in providing a fun game that people would actually play and enjoy. However,
          we did almost no testing outside of functional testing, and this showed through during our project pitch.</p>
        <p>The final change I would make if taking this course again would be to ensure that I began working on my portfolio
          earlier. I have managed to leave it to last minute while trying to juggle exams at the same time, and I think the
          website could have turned out a lot better if I spent more time working on it as such.</p>
        <p>As for changes I would make to the course, there’s not much. I really enjoyed Matt’s lectures and the input given
          to students by the tutors while in the Workshops and Contact sessions. The only item I would change would be to
          have the Workshop sessions lead more by the tutors. A lot of the time I came in and was a bit confused as to what
          exactly I should be doing, and how I should be doing it. A little more guidance by the leading tutor would better
          help a student’s learning as it’s often much easier to learn if taught by someone rather than reading words off
          a screen and asking for help when needing it.</p>
